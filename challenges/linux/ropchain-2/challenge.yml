    This attack requires reading the `example.c` code, and figuring out the logic to get the flag.

    Can you modify the `attack.py` script to exploit the `./example` binary?

    Tips:
      - To copy, select using your mouse, right click, and click "Copy".

        You must:
          1. read `./example.c` to understand what function you need to call
          2. run `./create-table.py` to get information about register layout
          3. edit `./attack.py` using the function name and `eip` offset
          4. run `./attack.py`

        Make sure you're looking at the `cyclic_find` column from `./create_table.py`.
        This tells you the amount of padding necessary to overwrite each buffer.
        A value of `-1` means that the buffer was not found in the crash dump, and likely can't be overwritten.
