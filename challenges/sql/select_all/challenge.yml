    -- Great job!
    --
    -- Now, let's prepare to use what you've learned to attack a system.
    -- You will get a chance to do this for real in the next challenge.
    --
    -- Imagine a company has private information in some flashcards.
    --
    -- So, they write code like this:
    --     SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE authorId = 2;
    --
    -- This code will return all of the flashcards written by Bob (authorId = 2).
    --
    -- We know you can see all of the flashcards with a query like:
    --     SELECT * FROM flashcards;
    --
    -- But, what if you could only add to this statement? What if you couldn't remove anything?
    -- Could you find a way to see other people's flashcards?
    --
    -- Yes! If you make the selection always true, it will select everything.
    --
    -- Looking at the query below, you can add this to get all the flashcards:
    --      OR 1=1
    -- It won't matter if the authorId matches, because 1 always equals 1.

    -- Can you make this query return all flashcards by only adding to it?

    SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE authorId = 2;

    -- This same principle will be used for SQL injections.
