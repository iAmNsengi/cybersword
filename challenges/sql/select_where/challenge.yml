    -- We know how to select all of the rows in a database with
    --      SELECT * FROM ____;
    --
    -- The query at the bottom gets all of the flashcards.
    -- However, if you want to select which rows are returned,
    -- you can use a WHERE clause:
    --      SELECT * FROM ____ WHERE columnName = ____;

    -- Can you make this query only select flashcards by "Bob" (a.k.a "authorId = 2")?

    SELECT * FROM flashcards;
