    Let's continue using the document viewer.

    Open the Document Viewer at: <a href="/document-viewer" target="_blank">`/document-viewer`</a>

    When you run the query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM documents WHERE securityCode = 'Whatever';
    ```
    you are using `*` to query all of the columns from the `documents` table.

    On the same database, there is a table called `notes` that has the same columns as documents.

    Can you craft a SQL injection that returns all of the rows from the `notes` table?

    There are at least two ways to attack this.

    Good luck.
