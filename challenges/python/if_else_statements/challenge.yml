    # Now, you've seen how to make decisions with if statements.

    # We can also use `elif` and `else`:
    # - `elif` is an if statement that is only checked 
    #   when the previous if statement is false.
    # - `else` runs when all of the previous if statements are False.

    if 1 > 2:
        print("one is greater than two")
    elif False: # change this to True
        print("elif is checked when the previous if statement is False")
    else:
        print("no cases were true")
