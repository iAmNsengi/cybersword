    # In Python, whitespace matters.

    # We can use if statements to make decisions.
    # The first if statement is correct.
    # The last two need to be fixed.

    # Can you fix the last two if statements, 
    # so they look like the first if statement?

    # This correctly prints "one is less than two"
    if 1 < 2:
        print("one is less than two")
    
    # This if statement isn't indented, so our program won't run.
    if 3 < 4:
    print("three is less than four")

    # This if statement isn't true, so nothing is printed.
    if 5 > 6:
        print("five is less than six")
