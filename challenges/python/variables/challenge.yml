    # We can control what our computer knows with variables.

    # We use the equals sign ("=") to create a variable.

    # Variables can have different "types".

    # a has type 'int' (also known as an integer or number)
    a = 1

    # b has type 'float' (also known as a decimal number)
    b = 1.23

    # greeting and location have type 'str' (also known as a string of text)
    greeting = 'hello '
    location = 'world'

    # Can you make a variable called 'c' that contains the value `a + b`?

    # Can you make a variable called 'd' that contains the value `greeting + location`?


    # üí° Notice how the same operation (+) is treated
    # differently on variables of different types.

# Flags specify answers that your challenge use. You should generally provide at least one.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts strings or dictionaries of CTFd API data
flags:
    # A static case sensitive flag
    - cybersword{this_flag_may_vary}

# Topics are used to help tell what techniques/information a challenge involves
# They are generally only visible to admins
# Accepts strings
topics:
    - python

# Hints are used to give players a way to buy or have suggestions. They are not
# required but can be nice.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts dictionaries or strings
hints:
    - "Press tab to indent code."
    - "You can also use Ctrl + `]` to indent and Ctrl + `[` to un-indent."

# Requirements are used to make a challenge require another challenge to be
# solved before being available.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts challenge names as strings or challenge IDs as integers
requirements:
    - "Welcome"
    - "Hello, World!"

# The state of the challenge.
# If the field is omitted, the challenge is visible by default.
# If provided, the field can take one of two values: hidden, visible.
state: visible

# Specifies what version of the challenge specification was used.
# Subject to change until ctfcli v1.0.0
