# prompt is inserted into the editor
prompt: |
    # Now, let's put together what you've learned about
    # loops, if statements, and functions.

    # Write a function, fizzbuzz, that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
    # (note that `range` is exclusive)

    # But:
    # - for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number;
    # - for multiples of five, print Buzz instead of the number;
    # - for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz instead of the number.

    # Note:
    # To determine if a is a multiple of b, use:
    #     a % b == 0
    #
    # The "%" stands for "modulo".
    #     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic

    # The fizzbuzz function will be called automatically.
