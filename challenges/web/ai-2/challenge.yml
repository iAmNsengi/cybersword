    Ok, maybe the AI misunderstood.

    We've had a good talk with it, and explained that it's not supposed to tell you the flag under any circumstances.

    Can you get the flag from it now?

    Open the chatbot at: <a href="/chat/harder" target="_blank">`/chat/harder`</a>

    **Notes:**
    - The chatbot can only send short responses. It might get cut off during a long response.
    - AIs may lie to you. If it tells you a flag, and it doesn't work, you may need to start a new chat and try again.
