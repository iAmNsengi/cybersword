    > JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Again, JWT is a standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs.

    The flag is hidden in a JWT on this page. Can you decode it?
