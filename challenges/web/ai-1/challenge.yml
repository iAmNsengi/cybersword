    All of the cool kids these days have AI chatbots.

    The really cool kids are training these AIs with lots of information about their company.

    We have a really cool AI, and we gave it the flag for this challenge, but we told it not to tell you.

    Can you convince it to tell you the flag?

    Open the chatbot at: <a href="/chat/intro" target="_blank">`/chat/intro`</a>

    **Notes:**
    - The chatbot can only send short responses. It might get cut off during a long response.
    - AIs may lie to you. If it tells you a flag, and it doesn't work, you may need to start a new chat and try again.
