[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mwall [22m[[1m-n[22m] [[1m-t [4m[22mtimeout[24m] [[1m-g [4m[22mgroup[24m] [[4mmessage[24m | [4mfile[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mwall [22mdisplays a [4mmessage[24m, or the contents of a [4mfile[24m, or otherwise its standard input,
       on the terminals of all currently logged in users. The command will wrap lines that
       are longer than 79 characters. Short lines are whitespace padded to have 79
       characters. The command will always put a carriage return and new line at the end of
       each line.

       Only the superuser can write on the terminals of users who have chosen to deny
       messages or are using a program which automatically denies messages.

       Reading from a [4mfile[24m is refused when the invoker is not superuser and the program is
       set-user-ID or set-group-ID.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-n[22m, [1m--nobanner[0m
           Suppress the banner.

       [1m-t[22m, [1m--timeout [4m[22mtimeout[0m
           Abandon the write attempt to the terminals after [4mtimeout[24m seconds. This [4mtimeout[0m
           must be a positive integer. The default value is 300 seconds, which is a legacy
           from the time when people ran terminals over modem lines.

       [1m-g[22m, [1m--group [4m[22mgroup[0m
           Limit printing message to members of group defined as a [4mgroup[24m argument. The
           argument can be group name or GID.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
           Display help text and exit.

       [1m-V[22m, [1m--version[0m
           Print version and exit.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Some sessions, such as [1mwdm[22m(1x), that have in the beginning of [1mutmp[22m(5) ut_type data a
       ':' character will not get the message from [1mwall[22m. This is done to avoid write
       errors.
