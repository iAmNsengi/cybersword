## STLP

So, we intended to have a group of like 20 to 40 high-school students, but instead we got 450 middle schoolers.

- 456 users registered (**453 students**; 3 administrators) 
- 13 IP addresses
- 510 total possible points
- 26 challenges
- Hello, World! has the most solves with 396 solves
- AI 1 has the least solves with 3 solves
- 420 right submissions
- 109 wrong submissions

---

This gives us an absolutely wild score distribution:

### Review

This was a good stress test of our systems I guess. We had a person outside the club repeatedly dumping fork bombs into the webshells during this time, and we saw little to no performance impact.

However, I'm not sure that telling 450 middle schoolers to write hello world was a valuable use of their time. I remember that filling out the sign-up form ended up taking the most time.

This event is intended to be one where taking your time to think really matters.

Just throwing people in to do one challenge didn't feel like the best fit.

I remember that most of the 8 year olds hadn't seen code before, so I remember getting some positive reviews. 

I'd love if, next year, we could get more older students to spend more time with it.
