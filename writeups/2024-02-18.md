| 2/18/2024 13:22:53 | I think it was super super polished, it was just extremely easy and seemed to go towards it from an angle of knowing literally nothing. Make it a bit harder, definitely enjoyed your program's vibes and your clubs attitude |
| 2/18/2024 13:33:39 | I genuinely like that you included a mini tutorial within the ctf. Poeple that already have experience can still have fun do the ctf, and those who don't are able to learn more and have fun at the same time.               |
