| 2/9/2024 13:37:06 | I learned quite a bit more about SQL. Since I had no experience with it at all. And it took me step by step, with help from the instructor. |

| 2/9/2024 13:38:54 | Event was fun and engaging, but the SQL section could benefit from more in-depth instruction.                                               |
