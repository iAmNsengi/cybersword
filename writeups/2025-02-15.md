![Top 10 Users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132d914a-8757-4722-9e09-5e17aedfe81c)

I see that a few people finished, with really talented students finding it very straightforward.

I see that people keep scoring even late into the game, which means they're not totally stuck.

Overall, I think this is a good spread of difficulty for a variety of skill levels.

So, the most critical feedback I'm seeing here is that I need to adjust the load on the [AI Hacking Lab](https://github.com/nkcyber/ai-hacking-lab). The issue here is that we literally don't have a GPU for our server, so this may be difficult to improve.

So, this makes me think we're doing a pretty good job!
