Count = 8 + 5 + 5 = 18 challenges

-----

Time limit: 90 minutes

Team of 1:
	90 minutes / (18 challenges / 1 person) = 5 minutes / challenge / person

Team of 2:
	90 minutes / (18 challenges / 2 people) = 10 minutes / challenge / person

Team of 3:
	90 minutes / (18 challenges / 3 people) = 15 minutes / challenge / person

-----

Time limit: 60 minutes

Team of 1:
	60 minutes / (18 challenges / 1 person) = 3.33 minutes / challenge / person

Team of 2:
	60 minutes / (18 challenges / 2 people) = 6.66 minutes / challenge / person

Team of 3:
	60 minutes / (18 challenges / 3 people) = 10 minutes / challenge / person

> [!WARNING]
> Hence, we might need to remove some challenges for 60 minutes, but a lot of the Python challenges go pretty quick if you already know Python.
> If we need to easily fit into a 60 minute slot, remove Python's FizzBuzz and Stack challenge.
