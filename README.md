# NKCyber Cybersword

Join Barty the Cyber Knight as he tries to earn the mystical CyberSword through a series of fun online challenges! This competition is intended for students who are looking to have a hands-on experience with Python programming, hacking, and cybersecurity.

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
> Remember to clone with `--recursive`:
> ```bash
> git clone git@github.com:nkcyber/cybersword.git --recursive
> ```

To run the services and CTFd, run:

```
docker compose down && docker compose build && docker compose up
```

To get started with this project, install the [CTFd CLI](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli) and run `ctf init` to initalze your project information.

See [`administration.md`](./docs/administration.md) for more information.

We can also use [the built in templates](https://docs.ctfd.io/docs/management/ctfcli/templates/).

## Service Deployment

Note that [automatic challenge deployment](https://docs.ctfd.io/tutorials/challenges/deploying-challenges/#automatic-challenge-deployment-service) is not available in the free version, which we're using.

As such, we have to take a more involved approach to challenge service deployment.

-------

To Do:
- Figure out how to host CTFd and several challenges all on the same server
    - NGINX reverse proxy
        - https://gcore.com/learning/reverse-proxy-with-docker-compose/
    - CTFd as a git subrepo?
- Clone structure of <https://github.com/adventofctf/2020/tree/main>
    - Then, set up github integration to update deployed version to latest git repo
- Create challenges:
    - [3d call to action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3m1PGEfG5c) - Barty needs your help!
    - Data commented out in webpage
    - developer tools
    - using code submissions for flags
        - Judge0 versus CTFd code submissions?
    - Teach Python:
        - variables
        - if statements
        - for loops
        - `with` connections for networks
        - establish a network connection to a service with pwntools, send it input, and then do something fun with the result
        - takeaway: know that you can use python to automate connection processing
- Story:
    - We are writing an [excuse plot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot)
        - [So you want to write an excuse plot (advice)](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteAnExcusePlot)
    - Where did barty come from?
    - **Key point:** Because we did the "CyberShield" compeition in the past. We're doing the CyberSword competition now.
        - What's the lore for the CyberSword
            - It's a sign of cybersecurity proficiency.
    - Why do we have to complete challenges to earn the cyber sword?
    - Things that the story should have:
        - I like the idea of a mideval knight not knowing anything about cybersecurity.
            - Therefore, the user has to support him in his efforts.
        - I like the idea of a mideval knight just wandering around northern kentucky.


State clear goal in "bookends" for each subject:
    - You don't have to know anything now
    - When you're done, you'll either win or know what you don't know
