## About
This project uses the [CTFd CLI](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli) for challenge management.

-------

To Do:
- Figure out how to host CTFd and several challenges all on the same server
    - NGINX reverse proxy
    - CTFd as a git subrepo?
- Create challenges:
    - Data commented out in webpage
    - developer tools
    - using code submissions for flags
        - Judge0 versus CTFd code submissions?
    - Teach Python:
        - variables
        - if statements
        - for loops
        - `with` connections for networks
        - establish a network connection to a service with pwntools, send it input, and then do something fun with the result
        - takeaway: know that you can use python to automate connection processing
